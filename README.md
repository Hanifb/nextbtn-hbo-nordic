# Next Episode button for HBO-Nordic

This is a small and lightweight Chrome extension that adds an next episode button on your HBO Nordic web player.

## Start being lazy

The current web player is 3 clicks and one scroll just to change to the next episode. This little extension it down to one.

## Installation

You can install the extension from [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbo-nordic-next-button/djaicpakelkcadoljpgfjhkajdfceadp)
